# Privacy Policy & Principles

Open-Price is built on the belief that privacy is a fundamental right, not a feature.

This document explains our privacy commitments, guiding principles, and how user data is handled (or not handled).

---

## Core Privacy Commitments

Open-Price commits to the following principles:

- **No data collection by default**
- **No surveillance-based monetization**
- **No advertising trackers**
- **No fingerprinting**
- **No sale or sharing of user data**
- **No requirement to create an account**

Privacy is preserved through design, not promises.

---

## Data Collection

By default, Open-Price collects **no personal data**.

Any data collection is:
- Explicit
- Minimal
- Purpose-specific
- Optional

Users can use the app without:
- Creating an account
- Providing an email address
- Providing precise location data

---

## Permissions & Consent

All sensitive permissions are:
- Requested explicitly
- Explained clearly
- Optional
- Revocable

This includes, but is not limited to:
- Camera access (for price or receipt photos)
- Location access (coarse by default)
- File uploads

Precise GPS location is **never required** and is always opt-in.

---

## Location Data

When location data is used:
- Coarse location is preferred
- Exact coordinates are optional
- Location is used only to associate prices with an area
- Location is never used for profiling or personalization

Location data is not retained beyond its functional purpose.

---

## Pricing Data

Pricing data submitted by users may include:
- Product identifier (name or barcode)
- Price
- Store name, address, and phone number
- Approximate location
- Timestamp

This data is treated as **public, non-personal information**.

No attempt is made to link pricing data to real-world identities.

---

## Analytics & Tracking

Open-Price does **not** use:
- Third-party analytics
- Advertising SDKs
- Behavioral tracking
- Cross-site tracking
- Device fingerprinting

If aggregate metrics are used in the future, they must:
- Be privacy-preserving
- Be documented publicly
- Never identify individuals

---

## Local-First Architecture

Where possible:
- Data is stored locally on the user’s device
- Syncing is explicit and user-controlled
- Offline usage is supported

This reduces unnecessary data exposure and centralization.

---

## Open Source Transparency

Open-Price is fully open source.

This allows anyone to:
- Audit data handling
- Verify privacy claims
- Identify potential risks
- Propose improvements

There are no hidden data flows.

---

## Security

We take reasonable measures to:
- Protect submitted data
- Prevent abuse or manipulation
- Respond responsibly to security disclosures

Security issues should be reported privately and responsibly.

---

## Changes to This Document

Any changes to privacy practices will:
- Be documented publicly
- Be version-controlled
- Require explicit user acknowledgment if impactful

Privacy guarantees will not be silently weakened.

---

## Final Statement

Open-Price exists to serve users, not to extract value from them.

If a future feature compromises privacy, that feature will not be built.

Privacy is not negotiable.
