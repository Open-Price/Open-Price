Working Title: OpenPrice (TBD)

1. Purpose & Vision
The purpose of this project is to create a consumer-first, privacy-respecting pricing transparency app that empowers individuals to understand what products cost in real places, at real times, without being surveilled, profiled, or exploited.
Modern consumers face increasingly opaque and manipulative pricing practices, including surveillance pricing, algorithmic discrimination, and location-based price manipulation. Prices vary not only by store and region, but by who you are, what device you use, and what data corporations have collected about you. This app exists to restore pricing transparency by shifting power back to consumers through crowd-sourced, verifiable, and openly governed price data.
Our vision is a world where:
    • Consumers can confidently determine fair prices in any location.
    • Pricing power is decentralized rather than controlled by corporations.
    • Transparency, not surveillance, is the default.
    • Trust is earned through design, not promises.
2. Core Principles
2.1 Privacy by Default
Privacy is not a feature—it is the foundation.
    • No user data collection by default
    • No ad trackers, no fingerprinting, no behavioral profiling
    • Explicit, granular consent for any sensitive permission (camera, location, uploads)
    • Coarse location tagging by default; precise GPS is always opt-in
    • Local-first architecture wherever possible
    • Users can contribute without creating an account
2.2 Radical Transparency
Trust requires visibility.
    • Open-source codebase to allow independent auditing
    • Clear documentation of what data is (and is not) collected
    • Public governance and roadmap discussions
    • Transparent moderation and validation rules
2.3 User Sovereignty
Users are contributors, not products.
    • Users control what they share and when
    • No dark patterns or forced permissions
    • Clear data retention policies
    • Ability to contribute anonymously
2.4 Anti-Exploitation Mission
This app explicitly exists to combat:
    • Surveillance pricing
    • Algorithmic price discrimination
    • Data extraction without consent
    • Corporate opacity around consumer costs
3. Problem Statement
Consumers lack reliable, unbiased, and privacy-safe tools to understand real-world product pricing across stores and locations. Existing price comparison tools are often:
    • Controlled by retailers or advertisers
    • Biased by affiliate incentives
    • Dependent on invasive tracking
    • Limited to online prices
    • Opaque in how prices are sourced
Meanwhile, corporations increasingly use personal data, location data, and behavioral signals to dynamically adjust prices—often without disclosure.
This app addresses that gap by enabling crowd-verified, location-aware, store-agnostic price reporting that works without surveillance.
4. Product Overview
The app allows users to look up and contribute product pricing in any specified area using:
    • Address
    • City
    • State
    • ZIP code
Each price entry includes:
    • Product identifier (barcode and/or text)
    • Price
    • Store name
    • Store address and phone number
    • Approximate GPS location (opt-in)
    • Timestamp and age of report
    • Optional photo or barcode verification
The system emphasizes data freshness, verification, and community trust rather than centralized authority.
5. Core Features & Roadmap
5.1 MVP (Must-Have)
The MVP focuses on utility, trust, and privacy.
    • Product search (barcode + text)
    • Manual and scanned price submission
    • Photo upload for price verification
    • Store and location tagging (opt-in, coarse by default)
    • Price history per product
    • Community validation (confirm, flag, dispute)
    • Anonymous usage without account creation
5.2 Power User Features (Phase 2)
Once core trust and usage are established:
    • Price accuracy score per contributor
    • Store price heatmaps by region
    • Alerts for price drops
    • “Best nearby price” finder
    • Offline price logging with delayed sync
    • Household staples watchlists
5.3 Advanced & Long-Term Features
    • Receipt scanning with automatic item extraction
    • AI-assisted fraud and anomaly detection
    • Predictive pricing trends (non-personalized)
    • Store price reliability and volatility scores
6. Trust & Data Integrity Model
Trust is established through community validation and transparency, not surveillance.
    • Multiple confirmations increase confidence scores
    • Photos and barcode scans increase verification weight
    • Disputed or flagged entries are visibly marked
    • Contributors build reputation through accuracy, not identity
    • Algorithms are documented and auditable
No hidden scoring systems. No shadow bans.
7. Organizational Commitments
The organization behind this app commits to:
    • Never selling user data
    • Never monetizing through behavioral advertising
    • Never introducing tracking without explicit user consent
    • Maintaining an open governance model
    • Designing for long-term public benefit, not short-term extraction
Any future monetization (e.g., donations, premium tools, enterprise analytics) must:
    • Not compromise privacy
    • Not bias pricing data
    • Be openly disclosed
8. Success Metrics
Success will not be measured solely by growth, but by:
    • User trust and retention
    • Data accuracy and freshness
    • Geographic coverage
    • Community participation
    • Independent audits and reviews
    • Resistance to exploitative industry norms
9. Closing Statement
This project is an act of consumer self-defense.
By combining crowd-sourced truth, privacy-first design, and radical transparency, this app aims to dismantle opaque pricing systems and give consumers the information they deserve—without asking them to give up their autonomy in return.
Pricing transparency is a public good.
This app exists to protect it.
