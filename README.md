# OpenPrice (Working Title)

**OpenPrice** is a privacy-first, consumer-focused app that enables people to see and share real-world product pricing—by location, store, and time—without surveillance, profiling, or exploitation.

This project exists to combat opaque pricing practices, including surveillance pricing and algorithmic price discrimination, by restoring transparency and consumer agency.

---

## Why This Exists

Consumers today face:
- Hidden price discrimination
- Location-based price manipulation
- Data extraction without consent
- Price comparison tools funded by ads and affiliates

OpenPrice flips that model.

No trackers.  
No ads.  
No dark patterns.  
No required accounts.

Just real prices, reported by real people.

## Core Principles

### 🔒 Privacy by Default
- No data collection unless explicitly opted in
- No ad trackers or fingerprinting
- Local-first architecture where possible
- Anonymous use supported

### 🔍 Transparency
- Fully open-source codebase
- Documented algorithms and validation logic
- Clear data retention policies
- Open governance and roadmap

### 🧍 User Sovereignty
- Granular consent for camera, location, and uploads
- Coarse location by default
- Users control what they contribute

---

## What the App Does

Users can look up and contribute product pricing using:
- Address
- City
- State
- ZIP code

Each price report may include:
- Product (barcode or text)
- Price
- Store name
- Store address and phone number
- Approximate GPS location (opt-in)
- Timestamp and report age
- Optional photo or barcode verification

---

## Feature Roadmap

### MVP (Must Have)
- Product search (barcode + text)
- Manual and scanned price submission
- Photo upload for verification
- Store + location tagging (opt-in)
- Price history per item
- Community validation (confirm / flag)
- Works without creating an account

### Power User
- Contributor price accuracy scores
- Store price heatmaps
- Price drop alerts
- Best nearby price finder
- Offline price logging (sync later)
- Household staples watchlists

### Advanced
- Receipt scanning with auto item extraction
- AI-assisted fraud detection
- Predictive pricing trends (non-personalized)
- Store price reliability scores

---

## Trust & Validation Model

- Community confirmation increases confidence
- Photos and barcodes increase verification weight
- Flagged prices are transparently labeled
- Reputation is earned through accuracy, not identity
- No hidden moderation or scoring systems
