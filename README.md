# Open-Price

**Open-Price** is a privacy-first, consumer-focused application that enables people to look up and share real-world product pricing by location—without surveillance, profiling, or exploitation.

The project exists to combat opaque pricing practices such as surveillance pricing, algorithmic price discrimination, and other predatory behaviors that disadvantage consumers.

No ads.  
No trackers.  
No required accounts.

Just real prices, reported by real people.

## Why This Project Exists

Consumers increasingly face:
- Location-based price manipulation
- Surveillance pricing driven by personal data
- Price comparison tools funded by ads and affiliates
- Lack of transparency around in-store pricing

Open-Price is designed to reverse that power imbalance by providing a community-driven, privacy-respecting alternative.

## Core Principles

### 🔒 Privacy by Default
- No data collection by default
- No ad trackers or fingerprinting
- Explicit, granular consent for camera, location, and uploads
- Coarse location by default; precise GPS is always opt-in
- Works without creating an account

### 🔍 Transparency
- Open-source codebase
- Public documentation of pricing and validation logic
- Clear explanation of what data is (and is not) collected
- Transparent moderation and governance practices

### 🧍 User Sovereignty
- Users control what they contribute
- Anonymous participation supported
- No dark patterns or forced permissions

---

## What the App Does

Users can look up and submit product pricing using:
- Address
- City
- State
- ZIP code

Each price report may include:
- Product name or barcode
- Price
- Store name
- Store address and phone number
- Approximate location (opt-in)
- Timestamp and age of report
- Optional photo or barcode verification
