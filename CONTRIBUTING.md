# Contributing to Open-Price

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Open-Price.

This project exists to protect consumers, restore pricing transparency, and resist exploitative surveillance practices. Contributions are welcome, but must align with these values.

Please read this document carefully before participating.

## Guiding Principles

All contributions must respect the project’s core principles:

- **Privacy by default** — no tracking, profiling, or unnecessary data collection
- **Transparency** — clear, auditable logic and documentation
- **User sovereignty** — users are contributors, not products
- **Anti-exploitation** — no features that enable surveillance pricing or consumer manipulation

If a contribution conflicts with these principles, it will not be accepted.

## Final Note

If you are looking to build surveillance-based monetization, dark-pattern UX, or data-extraction tooling, this is not the right project.

If you want to help consumers, increase transparency, and build ethical technology—welcome.
