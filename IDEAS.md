## Shopping List & Basket Comparison

Concept:
- User-created shopping lists
- Compare total basket prices across nearby stores
- Identify best-value store for a given list
- Highlight aggregate savings, not just individual item prices

Potential Enhancements:
- Support product substitutions when exact matches are unavailable
- Clearly label substitution confidence and assumptions
- Indicate data freshness and coverage gaps
- Allow opt-in alerts for list-level price changes

Constraints & Considerations:
- Depends on sufficient price coverage across stores
- Inventory availability may be partial, inferred, or user-reported
- Must preserve user privacy and avoid behavioral tracking
- No personalized pricing or profiling
